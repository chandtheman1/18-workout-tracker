# Fitness Tracker

An application that tracks your exercises. We can add exercises and look at our statistics over time in terms of the duration and the amount of weight carried. 

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
